Add a class
To add a new class right-click in the VSCode Explorer and select New File? This adds a new file to the folder you have open in VSCode.
Name your file MyClass.cs. You must save it with a .cs extension at the end for it to be recognized as a csharp file.
Add the code below to create your first class. Make sure to include the correct namespace so you can reference it from your Program.cs file.
C#
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
 public class MyClass
 {
 public string ReturnMessage()
 {
 return "Happy coding!";
 }
 }
}
Call your new class from your main method in Program.cs by adding the code below.
C#
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
 class Program
 {
 static void Main(string[] args)
 {
 MyClass c1 = new MyClass();
 Console.WriteLine($"Hello World! {c1.ReturnMessage()}");
 }
 }
}
Save your changes and run your program again. The new message should appear with the appended string.
console
dotnet run
Hello World! Happy coding!
